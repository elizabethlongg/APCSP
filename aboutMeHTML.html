    <p class="p">My name is Elizabeth and I was born in Oakland CA in 2006. I have a twin sister and a older brother. I go to Piedmont High School where I am on the robotics team and the water polo team. I am currently a sophmore. In my free time, I like to play ukulele, crochet, and hang out with my friends.</p>
